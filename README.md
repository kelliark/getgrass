3. Type and enter:
   ```js
   allow pasting
   ```
4. Then enter:
   ```js
   localStorage.getItem('userId')
   ```
5. Copy your UserID (without the quotes)
6. If you get an error after pasting allow pasting try type it and then enter and just go to step number 4

### 2. Setup Bot
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelliark/getgrass.git
   cd getgrass
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   

3. Install packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. Create `uid.txt` with your user IDs:
   ```
   userId1
   userId2
   userId3
   ```

## Run bot

- First option
```bash
python main.py
```

- Second option

python noremoveproxy_main.py

The script will:

- Move failed proxies to `error-proxy.txt`
- Assign new working proxies as needed

## Notes
- Automatically detect how many proxies and will divide all the proxies for all the accounts.
